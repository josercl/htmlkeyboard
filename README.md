#HTMLKeyboard

This is simply a keyboard made entirely with HTML, CSS and Javascript ([jQuery] (https://github.com/jquery/jquery). It stays hidden until a textfield is focused.

This was developed mainly because i had free time and was learning to use jQuery.

There is a working example [here](http://josercl.github.com/htmlkeyboard).
